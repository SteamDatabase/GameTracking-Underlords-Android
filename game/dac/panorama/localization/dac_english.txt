	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Turbo_2a"		"In Knockout mode, you start at Level 5, and choose a starter crew of 5 heroes that match the shown Alliances."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Turbo_2b"		"In this mode, if you take damage four times, you're out. But you'll also automatically level up, and you only need 2 units to upgrade a hero's rank."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Turbo_2c"		"Since this is your first time playing Knockout, rounds are paused by default. Once you're ready for the next round to start, hit the skip button up top."

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Normal_2b"		"Since this is your first time playing Standard, rounds will be paused by default. Once you're ready for the next round to start, hit the skip button above."


	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_1a"		"Dota Underlords is a game of strategy where you’ll battle against seven other players. Last player standing wins."

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_1aa"		"All Underlords games revolve around hiring and ranking up heroes, creating Alliances, equipping items, and the Underlords themselves."
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_1b"		"The only way to win is by building the best crew.  Let's hire our first hero. Open the SHOP by selecting the button above."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_1c"		"As you can see, each hero has their own strengths and abilities. To hire a hero onto your crew, just select one."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_1d"		"Drag your hero from your BENCH to the BOARD to get them into the next fight."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_1e"		"Fights happen automatically. Let’s watch and see what happens! "

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_2a"		"Great work - that was a loot round, which means you get to pick up an item to improve your hero. Take your pick!"
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_2b1"		"I can tell you have great taste! That Claymore will help your unit deal more damage."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_2b2"		"I can tell you have great taste! That Chainmail will help your unit take less damage."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_2b3"		"I can tell you have great taste! Those Gloves of Haste will make your unit attack faster."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_2c"		"To equip an item it’s as easy as dragging it from the sidebar onto your hero. Try doing that now."

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_3a"		"Looking good. It's a new round, which means more cash and new opponents. Who's up next?"
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_3b"		"Hmm, these guys look tougher, so let’s figure out how we can beef your Hero up. Let’s open the Shop."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_3c"		"Jackpot! If you hire two of the same hero, they'll combine to create a more powerful rank 2 Hero! (In some game modes three heroes are needed to combine.)"
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_3d"		"Look at that beefed up Hero. Why do they combine you ask? Good question. Great question. The answer is -- oh hey they're fighting!"
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4a"		"Easy peasy. Okay, that’s enough fighting creeps - next round you’ll be up against another crew of heroes. As always, here’s some more gold."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4b"		"You can see your opponent's info in the top left - in a real match you would battle against each other until only one Underlord is left."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4c"		"Ranking up heroes isn't the only way to get stronger. This flashy bit up on the right shows which Alliances your one hero can form."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4c1"		"Each hero can form two to three Alliances - getting the right mix of heroes on your crew can result in strong Alliance buffs."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4c2"		"Right now you don't have any active Alliances. Let’s open the Shop and see if we can hire a hero to complete an Alliance."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4d"		"Nice, looks like you’ll be able to complete one of your Alliances if you hire the highlighted hero! Let’s get them on the team."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4d1"		"Drag your newest crew member onto the board to get them into the fight."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4e"		"Hmm, according to these red bits you can only get one hero onto the board. The number of heroes you can field is equal to your level number."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4f"		"This is your level indicator. You’ll gain 1 XP per round automatically, but you can also buy 5 XP for 5 Gold. Select the button above to buy some XP now."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4g"		"Great! Now you can field another hero on the board. Note that in some game modes you'll automatically level up and won't need to worry about XP."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_4h"		"With two heroes and one Alliance, I think we'll do fine in this fight. "

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_5a"		"Nice work on your first win against another (bot) player! Since you won, you caused damage to their team, and the Leaderboard has been updated."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_5b"		"As always, at the beginning of a round you get gold. This time, you also got a gem. Nice! So what’s a gem?"
	
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_5c"		"Hello and welcome to Dota Underlords! It sounds like you already have some experience with building crews and forming Alliances."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_5d"		"Just a couple things to cover now that you’re in White Spire - we do things a bit differently in this town."

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_6a"		"You’ll receive gems when you’re on a win-streak or lose-streak. Gems can be socketed into items to make them more powerful."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_6b"		"Items can have Attack, Defense, and Support gems socketed into them - one of each. To socket a gem, drag it onto an item."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_6c"		"There you go. You can tap or hover on the item to check out how it’s improved. "

	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_7a"		"The final piece is the Underlord, which is to say - you! The Underlord is the leader of the crew, battling for control of White Spire."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_7a1"		"Each Underlord has their own play style, strengths, and abilities. Normally you'd get to choose, but we'll pick one for you for now."
	"DAC_Tutorial_V2_Intro_7a1_new"	"In every match you'll choose an Underlord after your crew is settled - either Round 2 or Round 10 depending on your game mode. Let's take a look."

	"dac_glossary_gold_desc"				"Gold is used in Underlords to buy heroes (1-5 gold), reroll the Shop (2 gold), and buy experience (5 gold for 5 XP). Gold can be earned throughout the match in a variety of ways. A base amount of gold is earned after each round regardless of how you did in the last battle. In addition, bonus gold can earned from win streaks, lose streaks, and items. Gold can also be earned through interest – for every 10 gold you have at the beginning of a round up to 30 gold, you will earn 1 extra gold."
	"dac_glossary_hype"						"Hype"
	"dac_glossary_hype_desc"				"Hype is an Underlord's main source of power. As your Underlord gains Hype, their damage output increases (to a max of +50% at full Hype), and ability cooldowns tick faster (up to 40% at full Hype). Hype is generated at a constant rate - and each Underlord has different buffs that allow it to generate faster. Killing your opponent's Underlord grants 2x Hype generation, but getting humiliated by being Stunned or Hexed reduces Hype by 5 each second."
	"dac_glossary_level"					"Player Level"
	"dac_glossary_level_desc"				"When you earn enough XP, you will level up. XP is earned automatically at 1 XP per round, or can be purchased in the Shop - 5XP for 5 gold. Leveling up gives you several bonuses. Your crew count increases along with your level (at level 2 you can field 2 heroes, at level 5, you can field 5). The Shop odds change with your level as well – more powerful heroes will appear in the Shop as you level up."
	"dac_glossary_rank"						"Hero Rank"
	"dac_glossary_rank_desc"				"All heroes hired in the Shop start out as Rank 1. If you hire three of the same hero, they will automatically combine into a Rank 2 hero. Rank 2 heroes not only have more hit points and deal more damage, but their abilities also level up in strength as well. If you create three Rank 2 heroes, they will automatically combine into a Rank 3 hero."

Anessix turned to Little Revtel, and all the money and secrets that reside there.  And Enno... Well, Enno just kept being Enno and looked to be sovereign of The Warrens."

But the Earthbound Demon was not satisfied… she was playing a dangerous game with the Court of Ristul, and if they discovered her intentions everything she built would be reduced to ash."
	"DAC_citycrawl_complete_all"				"Territorial lines have been drawn, but The Story of White Spire is just beginning.  The City of Dastardly Delights has as many enemies as it has secrets… and it is only a matter of time before they come to light."
